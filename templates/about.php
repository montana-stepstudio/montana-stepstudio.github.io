				This space has been designed by a photographer and so has creative people and your needs in mind. Every aspect has been thought of as if it were a set build meaning every corner has something to offer, weather it be white floor white wall, white floor brick wall, wood floor brick wall, concrete floor white wall, we have every combination, not to mention the array of coloured backdrop papersâ€™.

				We at stepthirtyone believe that sustainability is key, and so during our refurbishments we have recycled in excess of 15 tonnes of waste. Where possible we also up-cycled to make unique features such as our kitchenette shelves made from our previous window ledges. We also donated a large proportion of things from our courtyard such as paving stones and wood to the Forest Gate community garden and some keen allotment owners.

				We want stepthirtyone to be a place for people to come together, work together and create together.</p>

				A bit about where our name came from. The number 31 represents practical yet creative energy, something we hope you will find in our space. It actually takes exactly 31 steps from our gate to our front door (test it if you like). We wanted to echo how many steps it takes for every project and that you can take your creative steps with us.
